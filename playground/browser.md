- fs ğŸ§¹ with a transform & browserify-fs
- os ğŸ§¹
- stream ğŸ§¹

3rd-party:

- fs-extra (only mkdirsSync is used in src it seems so maybe create our own func that uses 'fs', as fs-extra uses graceful-fs and not real fs) ğŸ”¨

## Build

- convert cjs -> esm ğŸ§¹
- support json import ğŸ§¹

## Misc
